I created these files from scratch in blender, but they are based on the idea of running a servo's motion through a Scotch yoke.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotch_yoke

These are made to fit the standard servo size, but of course manufacturing can vary.

The files are:
 - ScotchYok09.blend - the origonal blender file that includes both the support and the yoke
 - SupportOnly09.stl - the read-to-print file for the support
 - YokeOnly09.stl - the ready-to-print file for the yoke
 
 All files have been 3d printed on a filament printer without supports and work as expected.
